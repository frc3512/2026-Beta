# 2026-Beta — Prototyping & Test Repository

Purpose
- This repository is dedicated to rapid prototyping and testing of robotics code for the 2026 season.
- Use it to develop, validate, and iterate on experimental subsystems before they are merged into Alpha versions.

Branching & workflow
- main: current main version with all around code.
- Beta-<feature||prototype>: individual prototype branches for new testing code

Coding & review standards
- Keep clean, structured code
- Do your best to not stray to far from the main branch, merging in new features once they work

Version Management (V.U.R)
- The V (version) is the current major status of the robot, shows all major changes to the code
- The U (update) is the latest update, bug patch, or any other medium sized change
- The R (revision) is the last small change, code organization/clean-up, or readability change

This repo is for experimentation and verification: keep it organized, documented, and fast to run so prototypes can be iterated efficiently.

Current Version: 1.2.3
